<h3>A guide to more fully engaged conversations</h3>

<ol>

<li>Wait: Let the other person speak fully before asking questions. Try not to formulate a response before they finish.</li>
<li>Assume positive intentions: Assume that the other person has good intentions.</li>
<li>Use “I” statements: Use "I" statements to keep the discussion based on your personal experience, rather than pointing fingers.</li>
<li>Lean into discomfort: This discussion will likely be uncomfortable and challenging, but we think growth and learning can come from this place.</li>
<li>Embrace silence: Allow yourselves periods of silence if needed. Give yourself time to process what you've heard and talked about.</li>
<li>When wrapping up, thank each other. Deciding to talk to the other side isn't easy.</li>

</ol>
